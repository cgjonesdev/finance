                <h3>Money Management</h3>
                <p>Managing your finances can be a bit daunting. Knowing what to do with the money you've earned each time you get paid isn't as straighforward as it seems.</p>
                <p>Spendsy helps you navigate the difficult waters of budgeting with a simple, elegant solution to the questions, "How do I stay of top of my money", "How do I get out of living paycheck to paycheck", and "What's the best way to save for the future"?</p>

                <h3><a href="/balance_sheet">Your Balance Sheet</a></h3>
                <p>Having a balance sheet is something that can help tremendously. Being able to look at your assets, liabilities and the resulting equity gives a snapshot of your financial health and can help you identify expenses you may want to cut out of your spending.</p>
                <p>A balance sheet is an indicator of where you are with your finances and is something you can check in with often.</p>

                <h3><a href="/budget">A Budget</a></h3>
                <p>What finance application could survive without a budget?</p>
                <p>Your budget is one of the most powerful tools to guide and direct the allocation of your bills, savings, and spending money.</p>
                <p>A budget should be simple. It should tell you in no more than 3 categories what do to with the money you earn. You give it what you working with and it gives you a formula for success!</p>

                <h3><a href="/burnrate">Cash Burn Rate</a></h3>
                <p>What is a cash burn rate? Spendsy is very connected to the relationship between money and time. As you earn money, you spend money.</p>
                <p>As you're spending, the clock is ticking. Are you spending more than you're earning? less than you're earning? the same amount? How do you know? Well, now there's a way...</p>
                <p>Spendsy tracks exactly where you are as you progress through your pay period, so if you're overspending, you have an immediate indicator and help with adjusting your expenses to stay within your budget and stay on track with your financial goals.</p>
